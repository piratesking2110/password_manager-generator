# Password Manager



## **Issue it solves**

**(1)** Most of the times we forget our passwords for the site that is important to u but u dont use it most of the times

**(2)** we are insecure or dont trust other 3rd party application with our data so we store our data locally [encrypted]
  
### what does this Password manager do ?
**(1)** It will detect the site u are currently browsing and lood at the database if u have saved the password before   
	
**(a)** if yes >> it will promt u email and password || with copy option       
**(b)** if no >> u will have an option to add email/username and password for the site 

**(2)** It has inbuild customizeable password generator
